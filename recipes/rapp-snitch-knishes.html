            <h3>Steps</h3>
            
            <h4>Dough</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Whisk flour, salt, and baking powder in a bowl.</li>
                <li>Make a well in the center and add egg, vinegar, oil, and warm water.</li>
                <li>Turn the dough out onto the counter and knead until soft, smooth, and elastic.</li>
                <li>Wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 1 hour.</li>
            </ol>

            <h4>Filling</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Boil the potatoes until they can be pierced with a fork.</li>
                <li>Drain potatoes and mash with a potato masher or a fork.</li>
                <li>Heat a large cast-iron skillet over medium-high heat and add onions, jalapenos, ground beef, and 1 tbsp taco spice.</li>
                <li>Cook without disturbing until beef develops a crust(2 to 3 minutes).</li>
                <li>Flip with a spatula and break up the meat.</li>
                <li>Continue cooking until fully browned, about 2 minutes.</li>
                <li>Combine the ground beef mix with the potatoes and stir together. Allow to cool completely in the fridge.</li>
            </ol>

            <h4>Assembly</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Pre-heat the oven to 375 degrees and line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper.</li>
                <li>Take the dough out and allow it to come to room temperature.</li>
                <li>Divide the dough in half and flatten one half into a rectangle on a floured surface.</li>
                <li>Roll out into a larger rectangle(1/8 inch thick), pulling the corners as needed.</li>
                <li>Place about 2 cups of filling along one long end, about three inches away from the edges and drizzle with ketchup and mustard.</li>
                <li>Top the filling with 6 slices of American cheese.</li>
                <li>Beat egg with water and brush over the opposite end and sides.</li>
                <li>From the filling side, roll up toward the egg washed side.</li>
                <li>Press the filling in and roll over so the seam is on the bottom.</li>
                <li>Trim excess dough off the ends and mark the dough in 8 equal pieces.</li>
                <li>Flour the side of your hand and press into the marks, rubbing back and forth across the counter to separate the pieces.</li>
                <li>Position each piece with one cut end facing down and the other facing up.</li>
                <li>Squish down the top and tuck everything into the center to form a round knish.</li>
                <li>Repeat above with the remaining dough and filling. Brush the bottoms with olive oil and the tops with egg wash and place them on the baking sheet.</li>
                <li>Bake for 15 minutes, rotate the trays and cook for another 15 minutes(or until golden brown).</li>
                <li>Allow to cool until room temperature.</li>
            </ol>
